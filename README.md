# Graphics-in-real-time-of-ADC-ESP8266
This repo is about using the ESP8266 like a client server to work with a local server and graph the values of the ADC (of the ESP8266 WI-FI MODULE) using the IDE ARDUINO for programming it.
 I SAW SOME TUTORIALS HERE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS TOPIC.

It's important to see this tutorial, because in some cases you can't call the header library to run your webpage, so you have to do this method.
